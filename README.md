# 7-Months Work Log
### Data Source
I have recorded all the data using Google Sheets for a time period of 7 months i.e., from August 1, 2023 to February 24, 2024.

### Goal/ Objective
The main objective/ goal of this project is to gain an understanding of all the work that is done in a day and how the time is distributed/ spent in a day. 

### Introduction
This data analysis focuses on the work that I have done from August 1, 2023 to February 24, 2024. This small data analysis project has helped me strengthen my skills : **Google Sheets, and Tableau**. The main focus of this project is about all the Time spent on doing my works (such as Reading, Writing, Learning a new skill, working on Projects, Data Analytics (learning, practice), Social Media/ Engaging/ Content, Career Goals and other miscellaneous works) that take the most of my time in a day.
This data analysis not only gives the understanding of the work I have done in a day or in a month but also helps me manage my time more efficiently. The term ‘work log’ refers to the record of the work that has been done over a period of time. This ‘work’ can be about learning, reading, writing, practicing or of any kind. Maintaining this work log helps a person not only have an idea of the things they have done for the past days but also helps in developing and growing more as they go.

### Data Analysis Process
The data is recorded using Google Sheets, manually (in the sense, I have typed in all the data by end of the day). This was easier for me since I have already had a planned day every single time (mostly) but it would have been easier if I were able to use a productivity app.
The data collected in the Google sheets has different columns (attributes) and numerous rows. The attributes that have included in the Google Sheets are:
**Date :** Date the work was done (MM/DD/YYYY)
**Month :** Month in which the work was done.(MMMM)
**Day :** Day of the week (DDDD)
**Time (in hours) :** Determines the amount of time spent on each of the specific tasks, in hours.
**Work Description :** Determines the description of the task/ work.
**Category ID :** It is the ID for the Category under which the task/ work falls.
**Total Time (in hours) :** Total time spent on different tasks for the day.
**Categories :** List of the Categories (data for a total of 8 different categories were recorded).

I have not only recorded data using Google Sheets but also created a Dashboard using Google Sheets (Link for this can be found below).
This dashboard in the Google Sheets not only has visualizations but also Summary Tables like the Total Time spent and Average Time spent (in Hours) (for each month, each day of the week, for each category) and also has a summary table for the General Stats i.e., showing the Aggregate values for the data table such as the Total time spent, Average time spent, Maximum and Minimum amount of time spent and also Average Time spent per week.

**Note:** I have created the Dashboard in the same worksheet as of the recorded data as I have less number of columns and it was quicker for me to work with.
Creating a Dashboard in the same worksheet of data was easier and quicker for me but when working with numerous columns of data and for any organization, it is appreciated to have a dashboard and data on different sheets.

### Tableau
I have also used Tableau Worksheets and Dashboard in order to create visualizations. In order to create a dashboard in Tableau, I only need the data so I have duplicated my Google Sheet and have deleted the visualizations, summary tables and other columns that I will not be using. (Link for this can be found below).

Though I have worked on Tableau before, the main goal here for me is to determine the key metrics and create an effective visualization. This helps me in creating good and effective visualizations instead of a messy visualization.

### Conclusion
Following are the insights and recommendations drawn from the data analysis:

### _Insights/ Results_
- Over a period of 7 months (August 1, 2023 to February 24, 2024), a total of 813.82 hours were spent working on different categories of work of which posting on Social Media such as Pinterest, Instagram has taken most of the time, being 255.08 hours.
- Total of 503 rows of data has been recorded for 7 months (August 1, 2023 to February 24, 2024) and a total time spent working on tasks is 813.82 hours.
- The Maximum amount of time spent was in the month of February 2024 i.e.148.47 Hours.
- The minimum amount of time spent was in the month of August 2023 i.e. 80.83 Hours.
- Of total 208 days for 7 months, I have worked for 173 days and on an average of 4.70 hours on each day of the month.
- I have worked for maximum hours on Wednesdays. The total amount time spent over 7 months on Wednesdays is 139.62 hours i.e., on an average of 5.2 hours for 27 days of Wednesdays.
- The month August has the lowest productivity i.e. about 80.83 hours of work.
- On an average, I have worked about 25 days a month for the past 6 months.
So, from all the data it is clear that I was more productive on Wednesdays, and I have spent more time on Socials which was mostly in the months August, September, October and November.
It can also be seen that my productivity has been increasing consistently every month, from December 2023.


### _Recommendations_
Considering it is important to manage time, in order to increase productivity and utilize the time of the day efficiently as well as having certain goals to reach in a targeted time, these are the following recommendations I think would be appropriate.
- Most of the time spent is on Socials, so it is important to manage time and focus more towards the less productive categories and they would be learning new skills, reading and writing.
- I have spent very less time in the year 2023, working on Data Analytics including the Google Data Analytics Certification and on projects as well. So, it is important to work for more hours on Data Analytics and towards career goals, considering having a target to land a Data Analyst job at the earliest.
